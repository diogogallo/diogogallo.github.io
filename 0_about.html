## About

I’m a Brazilian with a Bsc in Computer Science from Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), Brazil. I've been working for more than 10 years in software development with focus on web applications and integration systems. I have experience in leading and coaching of technical teams, working as software architect for Java technology. I have been very attached to agile methodologies, processes of development and design of products, such as scrum and lean, as well as, support and software consulting, very keen on providing practical solutions for clients.

I worked most of my career at Synchro, leading provider of tax solution in Brazil, because I believe in its values and feel part of its mission. I had several experiences that gave me technical and personal growth, always contributing to the company's business. 
Recently, I was working in a migration of the product to Cloud environment, using Microservices Architecture and integrating with other solutions, creating a single platform solution. 

In the past I worked at IBOPE Group which provides research on media, public opinion and other issues as required by clients. Working in the development and maintenance of several projects, using Delphi and Java languages ​​and Microsoft SQL Server database, I could exercise many different roles of software development, from requirements analysis and development to testing and deployment, applying the knowledge from University and making the base for my career. 

I'm passionate about new tecnologies and software development architectures, and looking into the future, I intent to use all the knowledge acquired during the years to become a better developer and software architect and help businesses figure out which technologies may be more fitting to the problems they are proposed to solve.

Work aside, I'm a photography enthusiast and I use this passion to boost my creativity, capturing images that have impact and feelings. I always try to use this creativity to adding to logical thinking of software development.

I'm leaving Brazil and moving out to Toronto, Canada. This is an extremely exciting new chapter of my life.
