We developed a product that integrates and manage electronic invoice's transmission from ERPs to Government, and it is used by the largest companies from various sectors such as IBM, Dell, HP, Amazon, Google, Vale, Caterpillar, Canon, Carrefour, McDonalds, and over 300 other companies. I implemented several new features, worked with customers on product performance optimization, performed the last level of support to clients, and was product's technical leader, planning, designing and coordinating activities to ensure that goals or objectives had been accomplished, with high quality product generation.

Working in the development and maintenance of several projects, using Delphi and Java languages ​​and Microsoft SQL Server database, I could exercise many different roles of software development, from requirements analysis and development to testing and deployment, applying the knowledge from University and making the base for my career.
